## 🎨 Filter Chain Architecture

### Signal Processing Pipeline (6 Stages)

```
Raw Input (12-bit)
    ↓
    Stage 1: CTLE
    └─ Boosts high-frequency components (compensates channel loss)
    ↓
    Stage 2: DC Offset Removal
    └─ Removes DC bias using high-pass filtering
    ↓
    Stage 3: FIR Equalizer (7-tap)
    └─ Linear channel equalization with symmetric taps
    ↓
    Stage 4: DFE (Decision Feedback Equalizer)
    └─ Non-linear ISI cancellation using previous decisions
    ↓
    Stage 5: Glitch Filter
    └─ Median-based spike/impulse noise removal
    ↓
    Stage 6: LPF (Low-Pass Filter)
    └─ Final smoothing and anti-aliasing
    ↓
Filtered Output (12-bit)
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### AHB Integration

```
AHB Master generates transaction
    ↓
slave_sel = 2'b11  (select Slave 3 - filter slave)
haddr = 0x4000_0000
hwdata[11:0] = 12-bit sample to filter
hwrite = 1
    ↓
Filter chain processes:
  - Cycle 1: Through CTLE
  - Cycle 2: Through DC-Offset
  - Cycle 3: Through FIR-EQ
  - Cycle 4: Through DFE
  - Cycle 5: Through Glitch
  - Cycle 6: Through LPF
    ↓
Result stored in memory
    ↓
Read with hwrite = 0 to retrieve filtered data
hrdata[11:0] = filtered result
```

### Testbench Example

```verilog
// Write sample to filter
slave_sel = 2'b11;
addr = 32'h4000_0000;
data_in = 32'h0000_0ABC;  // 12-bit sample in [11:0]
wr = 1'b1;
@(posedge hclk);

// Wait for filter latency
repeat(6) @(posedge hclk);

// Read filtered result
wr = 1'b0;
@(posedge hclk);
result = hrdata[11:0];    // Filtered output
```

## 📊 Filter Details

### Stage 1: CTLE (Continuous-Time Linear Equalizer)
- **Purpose**: High-frequency peaking
- **Algorithm**: `output = input + (input - previous) >> ALPHA_SHIFT`
- **Parameter**: ALPHA_SHIFT = 2 (controls boost strength)
- **Effect**: Compensates channel attenuation

### Stage 2: DC Offset Removal
- **Purpose**: Remove DC bias and low-frequency drift
- **Algorithm**: Exponential moving average HPF
- **Parameter**: ALPHA_SHIFT = 4 (controls cutoff)
- **Effect**: Ensures signal is centered

### Stage 3: FIR Equalizer
- **Purpose**: Linear channel equalization
- **Taps**: 7 symmetric coefficients [-32, -64, 128, 256, 128, -64, -32]
- **Algorithm**: Convolution with tap coefficients
- **Effect**: Shapes frequency response

### Stage 4: DFE (Decision Feedback Equalizer)
- **Purpose**: Non-linear ISI cancellation
- **Taps**: 4 feedback taps [256, 128, 64, 32]
- **Algorithm**: `output = input - sum(previous_decisions × taps)`
- **Effect**: Removes inter-symbol interference

### Stage 5: Glitch Filter
- **Purpose**: Impulse/spike noise removal
- **Algorithm**: 3-point median with spike detection
- **Threshold**: 512 (spike detection level)
- **Effect**: Removes isolated noise spikes

### Stage 6: LPF (Low-Pass FIR Filter)
- **Purpose**: Final smoothing and anti-aliasing
- **Taps**: 5-point [1, 2, 3, 2, 1] normalized by 9
- **Algorithm**: Weighted averaging
- **Effect**: Gaussian smoothing of output

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Filtered Output
**Check:**
- Is `hresetn` asserted properly?
- Is `slave_sel = 2'b11` during write?
- Are you waiting 6+ cycles after write?

### Issue: Data Looks Wrong
**Check:**
- Is clock running stably?
- Is `enable` signal asserted?
- Check filter input via simulation waveforms

### Issue: Synthesis Errors
**Check:**
- All module instantiations present
- Port widths match
- No undefined signals
- Review elaboration report

### Solution
See [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) Troubleshooting section for detailed help.

## 🎓 Theory & Background

### Wireline Receiver Signal Path
The filter chain implements the standard signal processing pipeline used in:
- High-speed serial links (PCIe, 10G Ethernet, etc.)
- Optical receiver front-ends
- General-purpose data recovery
- Signal conditioning applications

### Why Each Filter?
1. **CTLE**: Equalizes lossy channel response
2. **DC Removal**: Prevents saturation in subsequent stages
3. **FIR-EQ**: Handles linear distortion
4. **DFE**: Addresses non-linear ISI
5. **Glitch**: Removes impulse noise
6. **LPF**: Final smoothing and anti-aliasing

- IEEE 802.3 (High-speed serial interfaces)
- Widrow & Hoff - Adaptive filtering (1960s)
- Signal Processing textbooks - FIR/DFE design
